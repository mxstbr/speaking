# Max Stoiber Speaker Resources

Hi! ðŸ‘‹

You're probably looking for my information for a speaking engagement. Below you will find everything you need, if something is missing feel free to open an issue and I'll add it!

## Biography

There are two versions of my bio: [short](#short) and [long](#long). They are written in third person, feel free to rewrite them into first person if you need to.

### Short

Max is the technical cofounder of Spectrum.chat. He makes styled-components, react-boilerplate, KeystoneJS and micro-analytics.

### Long

Max is the technical cofounder of Spectrum.chat, the community platform of the future. He also makes styled-components, react-boilerplate, micro-analytics and a bunch of other open source projects and he co-organises the ReactVienna meetup. He loves to travel, to brew rad coffee and to ski beautiful mountains.

## Photos

You can get a HQ version of my profile image here: `http://mxstbr.com/headshot.jpeg`. (careful: very high quality, 4000x4000px)

> You can also use the link directly instead of downloading the image, as I plan to keep the link for the years to come. Please don't forget to load it through an image CDN like `img.gs` though, so your users don't have to load megabytes of image data!

There is also a `/photos` directory in this repository containing a variety of photos of me that you can use.
